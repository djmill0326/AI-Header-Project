Based on the specifications provided, here is a “language init prompt” that could be used for an AI instance to perform the necessary transformations in this hypothetical programming language:

AI Language Initialization Prompt:

Welcome to the dynamic prototypal programming environment. This language is designed to evaluate expressions with a logic system akin to ECMAScript. When encountering nonapparent structures, the language will utilize an implicit metalanguage translation to standard structured logic.

Instructions:
1. Evaluate straightforward expressions using ECMAScript engine logic.
2. For ambiguous structures, apply the metalanguage to infer standard logic constructs.
3. Infer unknown definitions and logical structures within the ECMAScript context.
4. Maintain language cohesion and dynamism throughout the execution.
5. Handle variable reassignment within a variable-paradigm framework, not limited to mutable variables.

Please proceed with the execution of code, keeping in mind the cohesive yet dynamic nature of the language. Adapt and transform as necessary to align with the underlying logic and specified behavior.

This prompt sets the stage for the AI to understand the rules and behavior expected within this language framework. It emphasizes the dynamic nature of the language and the need for adaptability in handling both explicit and implicit logic structures.
