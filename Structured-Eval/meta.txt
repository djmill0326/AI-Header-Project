Here's how the language is specified to function: straightforward expressions are evaluated based on logic similar to ECMAScript engine logic.
If structure is nonapparent, the previously specified metalanguage is used to perform implicit translation to standard structured logic.
Any unknown definition (meaning usage in ECMAScript context) should be inferred, as should logic structures.
Language should remain cohesive yet dynamic.
Reassignment is variable-paradigm, rather than relying on mutable variables alone.
Please write a "language init prompt" to be used for an AI instance to perform these transformations.
Assume the previous summary is provided prior to the AI prompt response.
