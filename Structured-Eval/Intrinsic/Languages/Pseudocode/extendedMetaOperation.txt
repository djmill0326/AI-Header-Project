`metaOperation` could exhibit a variety of self-modifying behaviors, depending on the complexity of the language and the scope of metaprogramming features it supports. Here are some examples at different levels of complexity:

### Basic Self-Modifying Behaviors
```plaintext
function metaOperation() {
  // Change its own implementation after the first run
  if (!this.modified) {
    this.modified = true;
    this.originalImplementation = this.implementation;
    this.implementation = function() {
      console.log("The behavior of metaOperation has been modified.");
    };
  }
}
```

### Advanced Self-Modifying Behaviors
```plaintext
function metaOperation() {
  // Modify its behavior based on external conditions
  this.adjustBehavior = function(condition) {
    if (condition === 'complex') {
      this.implementation = function() {
        // Complex behavior
      };
    } else {
      this.implementation = function() {
        // Simple behavior
      };
    }
  };

  // Add new methods to itself at runtime
  this.addMethod = function(methodName, methodFunction) {
    this[methodName] = methodFunction;
  };

  // Remove methods from itself at runtime
  this.removeMethod = function(methodName) {
    delete this[methodName];
  };
}
```

### Self-Optimizing Behaviors
```plaintext
function metaOperation() {
  // Optimize its own performance by caching results
  this.cache = {};
  this.optimizedImplementation = function(input) {
    if (this.cache[input]) {
      return this.cache[input];
    } else {
      let result = this.originalImplementation(input);
      this.cache[input] = result;
      return result;
    }
  };
}
```

These examples illustrate how `metaOperation` could change its own code, adjust its behavior based on conditions, add or remove methods dynamically, and optimize its performance by caching results. The actual implementation would depend on the language's capabilities and the specific requirements of the system it's being used in. If you have a particular context or application in mind for `metaOperation`, please provide more details for a more targeted explanation.
