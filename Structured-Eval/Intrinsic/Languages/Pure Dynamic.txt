To create a "dynamic quinelike self-defining language definition structure" that derives meaning from foundational programming concepts and the concept of language itself, we would need to start with the most basic elements of communication in programming: variables, functions, and control structures. Here's a conceptual example:

```javascript
// Dynamic Quinelike Self-Defining Language Definition Structure

// Initialize the language as an empty object
let Language = {};

// Define a method to create new variables and functions
Language.define = function(identifier, value) {
  this[identifier] = value;
};

// Define a method to evaluate expressions
Language.evaluate = function(expression) {
  let evalFunction = new Function('return ' + expression);
  return evalFunction.call(this);
};

// Define a method to output results
Language.output = function(output) {
  console.log(output);
};

// Self-definition of the language using its own methods
Language.define('self', Language);

// Example usage of the language to define and evaluate an expression
Language.define('greeting', 'Hello, world!');
Language.output(Language.evaluate('self.greeting')); // Outputs: Hello, world!

// The language can modify its own structure
Language.define('updateGreeting', function(newGreeting) {
  this.greeting = newGreeting;
});

// Update the greeting and output the result
Language.self.updateGreeting('Hello, universe!');
Language.output(Language.evaluate('self.greeting')); // Outputs: Hello, universe!
```

This code snippet demonstrates a language that can define its own structure and operations. It starts with an empty object and adds methods to define variables and functions, evaluate expressions, and output results. The language then uses these methods to define itself (`self`) and perform operations, showcasing its dynamic and self-defining nature.

The language is designed to be cohesive and dynamic, with the ability to infer and translate nonapparent structures into procedural logic, much like the process of understanding natural language and translating it into structured code.
