Below is an example of standard collision logic for the Pong game using the basic "self-defined standard library" we outlined earlier. This logic will handle the collision of the ball with the paddles and the walls.

```javascript
// Define the standard library object
const StdLib = {
  // ... (other methods from the standard library)

  // Method to check for collision between two elements
  checkCollision: function(element1, element2) {
    if (element1.x < element2.x + element2.width &&
        element1.x + element1.width > element2.x &&
        element1.y < element2.y + element2.height &&
        element1.y + element1.height > element2.y) {
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
};

// ... (other game setup code)

// Update function with collision logic
function update() {
  // Move the ball
  ball.x += ball.dx;
  ball.y += ball.dy;

  // Check for collision with top and bottom walls
  if (ball.y <= 0 || ball.y + ball.height >= canvas.height) {
    ball.dy *= -1; // Reverse the ball's vertical direction
  }

  // Check for collision with the player's paddle
  if (StdLib.checkCollision(ball, playerPaddle)) {
    ball.dx *= -1; // Reverse the ball's horizontal direction
  }

  // Check for collision with the AI's paddle
  if (StdLib.checkCollision(ball, aiPaddle)) {
    ball.dx *= -1; // Reverse the ball's horizontal direction
  }

  // ... (additional game logic)
}

// ... (render function and game loop)
```

This collision logic checks for the ball colliding with the top and bottom walls of the canvas, as well as with the player's and AI's paddles. When a collision is detected, the ball's direction is reversed accordingly. The `StdLib.checkCollision` method is a simple bounding box collision detection that checks if any sides of two rectangles are overlapping. If you need more detailed collision responses, such as calculating rebound angles or incorporating spin, the logic would need to be expanded.
