# Conceptual Reward Function for Hapt-ARG-Experience

Imagine a graph where the x-axis represents 'x Progression' and the y-axis represents 'Reward Value'. The reward function could be shaped to reflect the engagement and satisfaction levels of the user throughout the hapt-ARG experience.

1. **Initial Engagement Peak**: At the start, there's a sharp increase in reward as (x) begins, creating an initial peak in engagement.

2. **Learning Plateau**: As (x) progresses, the reward value might plateau, reflecting a period of learning and adaptation.

3. **Discovery Spike**: When (x) reaches certain milestones, the reward value spikes, symbolizing moments of discovery and delight.

4. **Mastery Curve**: As (x) continues and the user gains proficiency, the reward function could show a steady upward trend, indicating increased satisfaction from mastery.

5. **Endgame Bonus**: As (x) approaches completion, a significant peak might represent the culmination of the experience and the achievement of the final goal.

The function could be a combination of linear and non-linear segments, reflecting the dynamic nature of user engagement over time as a function of the experience progression.
